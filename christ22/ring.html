			<p>You think I'm actually going to get a real ring with valuable minerals, well ypou thought wrong. I'm probably never going to get a real ring but I do enjoy the thought of a fidget ring. It's a ring that has a ring shaped metal that spins as you touch it. I wish for that because it seems pretty fun to play with during boring situations.</p>
