			<p>I wish for a wonderful gpu for christmas, aka the RTX 3060 ti. This would be such a big increase in performance over my current setup I own. I could run so much games much better and at higher graphics with the "rtx" feature of the gpu. Even if this gpu is $500+ dollars I have a mission to get this thing.</p>
