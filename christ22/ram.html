			<p>These are computer ram sticks as shown in the image, these small and skinny sticks allow a comuter to run faster in performance. They also allow a user to open more browsers in a internet browser without crashing their pc. So if I get more ram then I wont have to worry as much about my computer exloding on me for opening a bit too much tabs for research purposes.</p>
