			<p>This is an iphone. An old one at that, but this image is in fact just a fake. I actually want and wish for a iphone better than an iphone 6 plus. Specifically an iphone 11 as it's MUCH better than an iphone 6. Finally as known or unknown an iphone is like a computer that sits usually in my pocket and they are really helpful for fast use to recieve information.</p>
