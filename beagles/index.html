			<p>The Beagle is a breed of small hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The
			Beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a great sense of smell and
			superior tracking instinct, the Beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural
			imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The Beagle is intelligent but single-
			minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</p>
			<p>Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in
			Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North
			Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.</p>
			<p>Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and
			paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip
			Peanuts has been promoted as "the world's most famous beagle".</p>
